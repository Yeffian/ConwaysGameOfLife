## Conway's Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of John Conway's [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). It does miss the feature of creating your own patterns, but you can create them through the Unity editor by creating Scriptable Objects.

NOTE: The Gospers Gliding Gun pattern is not correct, it generates something which looks similar but does not have the same functionality. I probably inputted a wrong coordinate or something.
